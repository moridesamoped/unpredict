Antarctica, that's the place for me. Do you think you could move to Antarctica in the future? Which type of government would you create from scratch?",

            "King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizards, an Australian funk band, sing: Multi-factioned, rusting tractors. Dying heroes. Open your eyes and see. There is no Planet B. What does this mean for you?",

            "Some farmers get automatic payments when rainfall drops below certain levels. What if city neighborhoods had similar protection - getting funds as soon as heat, floods, or air quality hit dangerous levels? How would you use these funds to care for your community?",

            "Imagine if your city had sensors measuring water levels, and everyone got advance payments when they showed a storm surge coming. Would you use the money to evacuate earlier? Help neighbors move their cars? Stock up on supplies? What would change if you didn't have to worry about proving damage later?",

            "Due to climate change, some species of mosquitoes that carry viruses are moving into new areas. On top of that, some urban centers are in low lying areas that are more vulnerable to flooding. What if community 'disease forecasting' became as common as weather forecasting? How would you want your community to prepare?"
